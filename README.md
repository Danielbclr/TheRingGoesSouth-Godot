# The Ring Goes South | Godot Prototype

A tactical roguelike inspired by Lord of the Rings, focusing on party management, exploration, and turn-based combat, being developed with the Godot Engine.

This project is a migration and continuation of a LibGDX-based prototype.

## Platforms

- Desktop (Windows, Linux, macOS) via Godot Engine's export capabilities.
- Other platforms supported by Godot can be targeted in the future.

## Engine & Language

- **Engine:** Godot Engine (version 4.x recommended)
- **Primary Language:** C#
- **Secondary/Scripting:** GDScript may be used for simpler node interactions or where C# overhead is not necessary.
- **Performance-Critical Modules:** C++ via GDExtension could be explored for highly demanding systems if needed.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- [.NET SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) (version compatible with your Godot C# version, typically .NET 6 or newer for Godot 4)
- Godot Engine (version 4.x, with .NET/C# support enabled)
- Git (for version control)

### Installation & Setup
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourname/ring-prototype-godot.git # Replace with your actual repository URL
    cd ring-prototype-godot
    ```
2.  **Open in Godot Engine:**
    *   Launch the Godot Engine.
    *   Click "Import" and navigate to the cloned project's `project.godot` file.
3.  **Build C# Solution:**
    *   Godot should prompt you to build the C# solution upon first opening. If not, you can trigger a build via `Project > Tools > C# > Create C# solution` (if it doesn't exist) and then by clicking the build button in the Godot editor (usually near the top right).
4.  **Run the project:**
    *   Press F5 or click the "Play" button in the Godot editor.

## High-Level Features - Current Status & Godot Implementation Plan

This tracks features largely implemented in the original prototype and how they will be (or are being) realized in Godot.

### 🎮 1. Project Setup & Core Architecture
*   [✅] Establish base Godot project structure.
*   [✅] Configure C# for game logic.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] Main scene setup (`Main.tscn` or similar).
    *   [✅] Global managers (e.g., `ResourceManager`, `PartyManager`, `GameEventBus`) as AutoLoad singletons (C# scripts).
    *   [✅] Scene management system using `GetTree().ChangeSceneToFile()`.

### 🌍 2. Overworld Map System
*   [✅] Grid-based map with a static layout loaded from Tiled.
*   [⬜] Dynamic elements (weather, hazards).
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] `TileMap` node for rendering maps imported from TMX files (`battle_map.tmx`, `lotr_map.tmx`).
    *   [✅] `Camera2D` node for map camera controls.
    *   [✅] Party representation on map (e.g., a `Node2D` or `CharacterBody2D` based scene).
    *   [✅] Input handling for party movement (C# script).
    *   [✅] Map interactions (e.g., quest givers) using `Area2D` nodes or by checking `TileMap` tile data from scripts.
    *   [⬜] Fog of War (e.g., using a secondary `TileMap` for overlay, shaders, or light/shadow system).
    *   [⬜] Route calculation (`AStar2D` or custom pathfinding on `TileMap` data).

### 🧭 3. Exploration & Resource System
*   [✅] Resource tracking (Food, Firewood, Gold, Hope).
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] `ResourceManager.cs` (AutoLoad singleton) to manage resources.
    *   [✅] UI elements (Godot `Control` nodes like `Label`, `ProgressBar`) to display resources, updated from `ResourceManager`.
    *   [⬜] Logic to tie resource consumption to actions/terrain.
    *   [✅] Node types with specific logic (e.g., `QuestGiverNode.tscn` with attached C# script).

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 4. Party System & RPG Logic
*   [✅] Party members, classes, skills, basic leveling.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] `GameCharacter.cs` (or similar) C# class for character data (stats, skills, etc.). Consider using custom `Resource` C# classes for editor integration of character templates.
    *   [✅] `PartyManager.cs` (AutoLoad singleton) to manage the player's party.
    *   [✅] `Skill.cs` (and related classes like `SkillEffect.cs`) for skill definitions, potentially loaded from JSON or custom `Resource` files.
    *   [✅] `GameClass.cs` for class definitions.
    *   [⬜] Class Tree progression UI (using Godot `Control` nodes).
    *   [⬜] XP and leveling mechanics fully integrated.
    *   [⬜] Status effects system for characters.

### 💬 5. Dialog & Event System
*   [✅] Narrative choices, quest dialogs (loaded from JSON in original).
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] `QuestManager.cs` (AutoLoad singleton) to load and track quest data (e.g., from JSON files).
    *   [✅] `DialogScreen.tscn` scene with C# script (`DialogScreen.cs`) using Godot `Control` nodes (`RichTextLabel`, `Button`s) for displaying dialog and choices.
    *   [✅] Event triggers on map (e.g., `Area2D` nodes linked to `QuestManager`).
    *   [✅] Quest objective tracking (e.g., kill counters updated by `BattleScreen`).

### 🔁 6. Turn-Based Combat (Tactics Style)
*   [✅] 2D grid system, turn-based actions, skills, basic enemy AI.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] `BattleScreen.tscn` as the main combat scene.
    *   [✅] `TileMap` node for the battle grid.
    *   [✅] Combatant scenes (`PlayerUnit.tscn`, `EnemyUnit.tscn`) with C# scripts (`BattleActor.cs` base class, `PlayerUnit.cs`, `EnemyUnit.cs`).
        *   These scenes would include `Sprite2D` or `AnimatedSprite2D` for visuals.
    *   [✅] `TurnManager.cs` (or logic within `BattleScreen.cs`) to handle turn order and flow.
    *   [✅] Input handling for selecting units, movement, and skills (in `BattleScreen.cs` or dedicated input handler script).
    *   [✅] Skill range and AoE highlighting (e.g., drawing on a `CanvasItem` or using another `TileMap` overlay).
    *   [✅] Basic enemy AI logic in `EnemyUnit.cs`.
    *   [✅] Combat UI (`BattleUiManager.cs` or directly in `BattleScreen.cs`) using Godot `Control` nodes for action popups, health bars, turn indicators.

### 🏕️ 7. Rest System + Interactions
*   [⬜] Allow party to rest, restore, and trigger inter-character dialogs.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation (To Do):**
    *   [⬜] `RestSystem.cs` logic (possibly an AutoLoad or part of a `CampScreen.cs`).
    *   [⬜] `CampScreen.tscn` scene for rest UI and interactions.
    *   [⬜] Event triggers for camp events (ambushes, dialogs).
    *   [⬜] Resource consumption and recovery during rest.

### 📦 8. UI & UX
*   [✅] Basic UI for map, battle, dialogs.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] Scene2D.UI equivalent using Godot's `Control` nodes (e.g., `Panel`, `Button`, `Label`, `VBoxContainer`, `TextureRect`).
    *   [✅] `Theme` resources for consistent UI styling.
    *   [✅] Battle action popup menu.
    *   [⬜] Tooltips for skills, items, UI elements.
    *   [⬜] Inventory display and management UI.
    *   [✅] Basic mouse input support. Keyboard for shortcuts can be added.

### 📁 9. Data & Content Pipeline
*   [✅] Content loaded via JSON (Quests, Skills, Enemies, Classes in original).
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] Loading data from JSON files using Godot's `Json` class in C# or `JSON.ParseString()`.
    *   [⬜] Consider creating custom C# `Resource` types (e.g., `SkillResource.cs`, `EnemyResource.cs`, `ItemResource.cs`) that can be created and edited directly in the Godot Inspector for better workflow. These can still be serialized/deserialized from JSON if needed or use Godot's binary resource format (`.tres`, `.res`).
    *   [✅] Tiled maps (`.tmx`) imported via Godot's `TileMap` importer.
    *   [✅] Spritesheets/Textures imported into Godot.

### 🧪 10. Testing & Debug Tools
*   [✅] Basic logging.
*   [⚙️] **Godot Implementation:**
    *   [✅] Extensive use of `GD.Print()` (or `Console.WriteLine` in C#) for logging.
    *   [⬜] In-game debug console (a `Control` node scene with a `LineEdit` for commands).
        *   Commands to grant resources, spawn units, trigger events.
    *   [⬜] Seeded randomness for repeatable testing.
    *   [⬜] Consider using a testing framework like Godot C# Test (if available and mature for your version) or writing simple test scenes.
